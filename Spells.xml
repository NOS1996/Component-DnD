      <p>You create a bright flash of glittering lights around a targets face. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to look away or close its eyes. If it fails to do so, it takes 1d4 Radiant damage and has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. This spells damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4) and 17th level (4d4).</p>

      <p>You imbue yourself with celestial radiance, causing your skin and hair to glimmer with a silvery sheen. For the duration, fiends and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. Any time a fiend or undead rolls for melee damage to be dealt to you, it rolls the damage twice and uses the lesser roll. You also have resistance to Radiant damage.</p>

Cast as 5th level spell the radius increases to 10-feet for the bright light and 20-feet for the dim light. Furthermore if any creature is within this radius they can either avert their eyes from you until the end of their next turn or make a wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. Cast at 6th level you additionally gain resistance to necrotic damage. Cast at 7th level each round you can use your action to deal 2d4 radiant damage to all creatures inside the radius. Cast at 8th level you also gain resistance to nonmagical slashing, piercing and bludgeoning damage. Cast at 9th level the radius of this spell gains the properties of a magic circle.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You create three translucent shimmering shields that appear in your space and whirl around you for the duration. When you are targeted by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to interpose one of the shields. If the attack hits, the shield takes the damage instead of you. A shield can absorb damage equal to 3 times your spellcasting ability modifier. If the shield takes more damage than it can absorb, you take any overflow damage. Once you use a shield in this way and the shield is hit by an attack, it shatters. Once you use the last shield, the spell ends.</p>
      <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you create one additional shield for every two slot levels above 3rd.</p>

      <p>You end any effect that changes the form a creatures inside a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. Any creature in the area that has had its physical form changed by magic, including shapeshifting, spells, and afflictions such as lycanthropy, is reverted to its original, natural form. If the form change is caused by a creatures natural abilities and the creature is CR 6 or higher, it can make a Charisma saving throw to retain its current form. If the changes are a result of a spell of 6th level or higher (such as flesh to stone, animal shapes, or shapechange), you can make an ability check with your spellcasting modifier (DC equal to 10 + the spells level), ending the spell on a success. If the creature has been changed against its will, no check or save is required. At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the CR threshold for the saving throw increases by 1 for every slot level above 5th. You also automatically end any form-changing spell of a level equal to that of the slot you use.</p>

    <supports>Necromancer, Wizard</supports>
    <description>
      <p>You draw from the deepest depths of your grimoire a spell of utter foulness and cruelty, that prolongs the life of the caster or a chosen creature that is within 10 feet of the caster during the ritual of sacrifice. As part of the ritual you slay a humanoid and transfer its lifeforce to yourself or that of another creature. After succesfully sacrfifcing the humanoid you add the doubble of your original lifespan to your lifespan, as long as the dagger used to slay the humanoid is in your possession. A humanoid slain by the living sacrifice spell can not be restored to life by any means short of a wish spell. Restoring the slain humanoid to life forces the creature that benefitted from the sacrifice to instantly drop to 0 hit points and to make death saving throws with disadvantage, it cannot be stabilised, by any means other than success in their death saving throws, nor can it benefit from any effect that would aid them. You can cast this spell only once every ten years. If you cast this spell more than once, you begin to attract the attention of druids and celestials. You have a 5% chance to attract a druid or celestial with the goal of foiling your twisted magic and ending your foul life. Every casting after the second time adds another 10%. If you reach over 50% you have a chance of attracting 1 high level druid or a celestial lke a deva. If you reach over 100% you attract two high level druids or a celestial like a Planetar and so forth. If you reach over 150% you attract 4 high level druids or a celestial like a Solar.</p>
