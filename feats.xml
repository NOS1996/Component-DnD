            <p><i>Prerequisite: Bennir</i></p>
            <p>You unleash the power of your heritage, that was bestowed upon you by the elder stars, hidden deep beneath your veins it called to you from your very core, for you to become the epitome of the starborn. And you answered.  You gain the following benefits unleashing the full power of the Ben'nir:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>You awaken long dormant power within your bloodline. You gain the ability to cast Produce flame, Burning Hands and Alter Self at will, at certain levels.</li>

                <li>You gain immunity to radiant and fire damage. You count as a Celestial.</li>
            </ul>
