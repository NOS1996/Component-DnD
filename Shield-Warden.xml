			<p>Some martial proffessionals, most commonly thoose charged with work as bodyguards and guardians, are practitioners of a rarefied magical power, that enables them to project a protective arcane barrier. This shielding force is unusual in such a way that it draws from the users vital force and is not invoked by mere incantations. Skilled weilders of this protective forceare able to turn away even the deadliest and most withering attacks with casual ease.</p>
